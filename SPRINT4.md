In Sprint 4, we worked hard to try and get everything done. 

Unfortunaley, we had to cut a few features due to time constraints.
The main one of these being the messaging system on the app. We instead replaced that with a page that shows you the phone number and email of the rentee so you can easily get in contact with them.

We ended up relying on almost entirely PHP and HTML to get this project done, which was a bit different from what we envisioned when we first started.

Overall, this Sprint was a success for us since we got the majority of what we wanted to accomplish finished.

If we had more time, I'm sure we could've made a better and more expansive version of RenTen, but we are satisfied with the work we got done.
