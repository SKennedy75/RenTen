RenTen Commit Tracking

Commit 1: Creation of Repository

Commit 2: MySQL database by Steven

Commit 3: HTML for Profile creation by Dakota
    - I (Sean) made the commit for Dakota since he didn't fully understand how to do so

Commit 4: PHP file for displaying addresses from SQL database by Sean
    - Also minor changes to wording in the SQL database

Commit 5: Update to COMMITS and STYLE documentation

Commit 6: HTML file for displaying the Listings by Gurkirat
    - I (Sean) also made the commit for Gurkirat, but again it was his work

Commit 7: Added SPRINT3.md that covers thought process and how we used our time during the sprint, as well as changes to displayaddresses.php. These changes were to sync the HTML formatting with the way it was done in index.php so the style of the text looks the same across both files.

Commit 8: Updated database

Commit 9-24 were all done at the end of Sprint 4, and pertain to the finishing touches and new implementations we got done.
    Highlights of these commits include the updated index.php file, the addition of the rentainratings database, and the login page

Commit 25: Talks about our general thoughts after Sprint 4, and the satisfaction we have with the finished RenTen product

Commit 26: The final commit, that being this file

Commit 27: I guess that wasn't the last commit, we decided to add the screenshot outputs to the GitHub page as well.

Commit 28-30: I added the screenshots but made it the wrong folder name so I removed and re-added them.

Commit 31: Re-commiting the COMMITS.md file. This should actually be the last time (hopefully).
